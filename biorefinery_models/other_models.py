    #designed for around 35% of dry matter
    #hydrolisis time=140 hours
    #hydrolysis model: conventional CSTRs in series. reactor is modelled as a plug flow reactor.... why
    # all reactors in the series have temperature and ph controllers
    # concentration of acetic acid is wath affects pH. NaOH is used for pH adjustment
    # enzimes added from storage tank.

    # Fff=inflow of pretreated fiblers, initial composition C0 (measured with online NIR, measurements every 5 minutes)
    # FB= known flow of NaOH, CB NaOH concentration are known
    # FE, CB: flow of enzimes
    # All inflows measured with sampling period of 2 s
    # water added with flowrate FW
    # Output control: mass measurement and manipulate outflow of fiber mash (FFM), to keep connstant hold up. Outflow concentration C, sampled every 6 h, analized with HPLC.
    # output pH measured online with a sampling period of 10 seconds.

    # reactor tank exposed to atmospheric pressure

    # ALL FLOWS ARE MEAASURED!!!!!!
