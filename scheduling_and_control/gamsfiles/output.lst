    The user model has 2615 constraints and 2702 variables
    with 11317 Jacobian elements, 3060 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 186 elements on the diagonal,
    1260 elements below the diagonal, and 1086 nonlinear variables.
 
    The pre-triangular part of the model has 283 constraints and 215 variables.
    The post-triangular part of the model has 74 constraints and variables.
    There are 833 definitional constraints and defined variables.
 
    Preprocessed model has 1425 constraints and 1580 variables
    with 7588 Jacobian elements, 2766 of which are nonlinear.
 
 ** Optimal solution. There are no superbasic variables.
 
 ** Scaled model is feasible, but some unscaled residuals are large due
    due to large scale factors.
    Largest unscaled residual is 1.03E-04 based on scale factor 4.10E+03.
