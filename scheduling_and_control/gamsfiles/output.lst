--- DICOPT: NLP Subproblem was non-optimal but feasible.

      An NLP subproblem was not solved to optimality. The solution
      was feasible however, so this solution was accepted.
      You may want to rerun the model with a GAMS option
      OPTION SYSOUT=ON; to display extra solver information.
      The cycle in which this situation occurred is marked with
      *Nonopt*.
